# TEMA Emotion Detection

## Overview
This Python application leverages advanced machine learning techniques and computer vision to detect and classify child emotions from facial expressions in real-time. Built using TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning and OpenCV for image processing, it can identify a range of emotions such as Angry, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, and Surprise from both images and video streams.

TEMA was our Graduation project, and we had dedicated teams responsible for developing the deep learning model, the robot's hardware, and the Android application. I was part of the team that developed the deep learning model. You can find comprehensive information about the entire project in the provided Graduation-Project.pptx.

## Features
- **Real-Time Emotion Recognition**: Uses live video streams to detect and classify emotions as they occur.
- **Static Image Analysis**: Capable of analyzing emotions from static images.
- **Diverse Emotion Set**: Classifies emotions into six different categories, allowing for a broad spectrum of emotional recognition.


## Future Enhancements
- Improved accuracy and speed of emotion detection.
- Extension to detect more nuanced emotional states and micro-expressions.
- Real-time feedback mechanism for training and improving the model's performance based on new data inputs.
